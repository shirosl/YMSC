# 💙 Our Countdown — Always Close to You 💙

This little timer counts down to **Sunday 5:45 AM Malaysia time** —  
but more than that, it’s counting the moments until we meet again.

I miss you, and every second on this timer is one step closer to you.  
So, keep it on your phone, right where you can see it.  
Like me — always here, always waiting.

### 💌 Why I Made This
This isn’t just a timer — it’s a promise.  
No matter the hours, the minutes, or the distance,  
I’m here, counting down with you,  
until the moment I see you again.

So whenever you miss me,  
just glance at the timer —  
and know I’m doing the same.
